🏭 The CRM Digital FTE Factory Final Hackathon 5
Build Your First 24/7 AI Employee: From Incubation to Production
Duration: 48-72 Development Hours | Team Size: 1 Student | Difficulty: Advanced

Executive Summary
In this final and fifth hackathon, you will implement the complete Agent Maturity Model by building a real Digital FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) - an AI employee that works 24/7 without breaks, sick days, or vacations.
You’ll experience the full evolutionary arc:
Stage 1 - Incubation: Use Claude Code to explore, prototype, and discover requirements
Stage 2 - Specialization: Transform your prototype into a production-grade Custom Agent using OpenAI Agents SDK, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Kubernetes
By the end, you’ll have a production-deployed AI employee handling a real business function autonomously across multiple communication channels.

The Business Problem: Customer Success FTE
Your client is a growing SaaS company drowning in customer inquiries. They need a Customer Success FTE that can:
Handle customer questions about their product 24/7
Accept inquiries from multiple channels: Email (Gmail), WhatsApp, and Web Form
Triage and escalate complex issues appropriately
Track all interactions in a ticket management system (PostgreSQL-based - you will build this)
Generate daily reports on customer sentiment
Learn from resolved tickets to improve responses
Note on CRM/Ticket System: For this hackathon, you will build your own ticket management and customer tracking system using PostgreSQL. This serves as your CRM. You are NOT required to integrate with external CRMs like Salesforce or HubSpot. The database schema you create (customers, conversations, tickets, messages tables) IS your CRM system.
Current cost of human FTE: $75,000/year + benefits + training + management overhead
Your target: Build a Digital FTE that operates at <$1,000/year with 24/7 availability

Multi-Channel Architecture Overview
Your FTE will receive support tickets from three channels:

Part 1: The Incubation Phase (Hours 1-16)
Objective
Use Claude Code as your Agent Factory to explore the problem space, discover hidden requirements, and build a working prototype.
Your Role: Director
You are NOT writing code line-by-line. You are directing an intelligent system toward a goal.
Setup: The Development Dossier
Before starting, prepare your “dossier” - the context Claude Code needs:
project-root/
├── context/
│   ├── company-profile.md      # Fake SaaS company details
│   ├── product-docs.md         # Product documentation to answer from
│   ├── sample-tickets.json     # 50+ sample customer inquiries (multi-channel)
│   ├── escalation-rules.md     # When to involve humans
│   └── brand-voice.md          # How the company communicates
├── src/
│   ├── channels/               # Channel integrations
│   ├── agent/                  # Core agent logic
│   └── web-form/               # Support form frontend
├── tests/                      # Test cases discovered during incubation
└── specs/                      # Crystallized requirements (output)
Exercise 1.1: Initial Exploration (2-3 hours)
Prompt Claude Code with your initial intent:
I need to build a Customer Success AI agent for a SaaS company.

The agent should:
- Answer customer questions from product documentation
- Accept tickets from THREE channels: Gmail, WhatsApp, and a Web Form
- Know when to escalate to humans
- Track all interactions with channel source metadata

I've provided company context in the /context folder.
Help me explore what this system should look like.
Start by analyzing the sample tickets and identifying patterns across channels.
What to observe: - How does Claude Code plan the exploration? - What patterns does it discover in the sample tickets? - Are there channel-specific patterns (email tends to be longer, WhatsApp is more conversational)? - What questions does it ask you for clarification?
Document your discoveries in specs/discovery-log.md
Exercise 1.2: Prototype the Core Loop (4-5 hours)
Direct Claude Code to build the basic interaction:
Based on our analysis, let's prototype the core customer interaction loop.
Build a simple version that:
1. Takes a customer message as input (with channel metadata)
2. Normalizes the message regardless of source channel
3. Searches the product docs for relevant information
4. Generates a helpful response
5. Formats response appropriately for the channel (email vs chat style)
6. Decides if escalation is needed

Use Python. Start simple - we'll iterate.
Iteration prompts to use:
# After first version works:
"This crashes when the customer asks about pricing. 
Add handling for pricing-related queries."

# Channel-specific iteration:
"WhatsApp messages are much shorter and more casual.
Adjust response style based on channel."

# Email-specific iteration:
"Email responses need proper greeting and signature.
Add channel-aware formatting."

# After testing with real scenarios:
"The responses are too long for WhatsApp. Customers want concise answers.
Optimize for brevity on chat channels while keeping detail on email."
Exercise 1.3: Add Memory and State (3-4 hours)
Extend the prototype:
Our agent needs to remember context across a conversation.
If a customer asks follow-up questions, the agent should understand
they're continuing the same topic - even if they switch channels!

Add conversation memory. Also track:
- Customer sentiment (is this interaction going well?)
- Topics discussed (for reporting)
- Resolution status (solved/pending/escalated)
- Original channel and any channel switches
- Customer identifier (email address as primary key)
Exercise 1.4: Build the MCP Server (3-4 hours)
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is how your agent will connect to external tools. Build an MCP server that exposes your prototype’s capabilities:
Let's expose our customer success agent as an MCP server.
Create tools for:
- search_knowledge_base(query) -> relevant docs
- create_ticket(customer_id, issue, priority, channel) -> ticket_id
- get_customer_history(customer_id) -> past interactions across ALL channels
- escalate_to_human(ticket_id, reason) -> escalation_id
- send_response(ticket_id, message, channel) -> delivery_status

Follow the MCP specification for tool definitions.
MCP Server Template to Start:
# mcp_server.py
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.types import Tool, TextContent
from enum import Enum

class Channel(str, Enum):
    EMAIL = "email"
    WHATSAPP = "whatsapp"
    WEB_FORM = "web_form"

server = Server("customer-success-fte")

@server.tool("search_knowledge_base")
async def search_kb(query: str) -> str:
    """Search product documentation for relevant information."""
    # Your implementation from incubation
    pass

@server.tool("create_ticket")
async def create_ticket(
    customer_id: str, 
    issue: str, 
    priority: str,
    channel: Channel
) -> str:
    """Create a support ticket in the system with channel tracking."""
    pass

@server.tool("get_customer_history")
async def get_customer_history(customer_id: str) -> str:
    """Get customer's interaction history across ALL channels."""
    pass

@server.tool("send_response")
async def send_response(
    ticket_id: str,
    message: str,
    channel: Channel
) -> str:
    """Send response via the appropriate channel."""
    pass

# Add more tools...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run()
Exercise 1.5: Define Agent Skills (2-3 hours)
Agent Skills are reusable capabilities your FTE can invoke. Create skill definitions:
Based on what we've built, let's formalize the agent's skills.
Create a skills manifest that defines:

1. Knowledge Retrieval Skill
   - When to use: Customer asks product questions
   - Inputs: query text
   - Outputs: relevant documentation snippets
   
2. Sentiment Analysis Skill
   - When to use: Every customer message
   - Inputs: message text
   - Outputs: sentiment score, confidence
   
3. Escalation Decision Skill
   - When to use: After generating response
   - Inputs: conversation context, sentiment trend
   - Outputs: should_escalate (bool), reason

4. Channel Adaptation Skill
   - When to use: Before sending any response
   - Inputs: response text, target channel
   - Outputs: formatted response appropriate for channel

5. Customer Identification Skill
   - When to use: On every incoming message
   - Inputs: message metadata (email, phone, etc.)
   - Outputs: unified customer_id, merged history

Create the skill definitions in a reusable format.
Incubation Deliverables Checklist

🔄 The Transition: From General Agent to Custom Agent (Hours 15-18)
This is the most critical phase of the hackathon. You’re transforming exploratory code into production-ready systems. Many teams struggle here because they don’t have a clear methodology. Follow this guide step-by-step.
Important: Claude Code Remains Your Development Partner
A common misconception is that you stop using Claude Code (the General Agent) once you transition to building the Custom Agent. This is incorrect. Claude Code remains your primary development tool throughout the entire hackathon. During the Specialization Phase, you will use Claude Code to: - Write the OpenAI Agents SDK implementation code - Generate the FastAPI endpoints and channel handlers - Create the PostgreSQL schema and database queries - Build Kubernetes manifests and Docker configurations - Debug issues and iterate on your production code
Think of it this way: Claude Code is the factory that builds the Custom Agent. The General Agent (Claude Code) doesn’t get replaced—it becomes the tool you use to construct, test, and refine your Specialist. This is the essence of the Agent Factory paradigm: General Agents build Custom Agents. You’re not coding alone; you’re directing Claude Code to help you engineer a production-ready system.

Step 3: Transform Your MCP Tools to Production Tools (1 hour)
Your MCP server tools need to become OpenAI Agents SDK @function_tool functions.
Before (MCP Server - Incubation):
# What you built during incubation
from mcp.server import Server

server = Server("customer-success-fte")

@server.tool("search_knowledge_base")
async def search_kb(query: str) -> str:
    """Search product documentation."""
    # Your prototype implementation
    results = simple_search(query)  # Maybe just string matching
    return str(results)
After (OpenAI Agents SDK - Production):
# production/agent/tools.py

from agents import function_tool
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
import asyncpg

# 1. Define strict input schemas

Step 4: Transform Your System Prompt (30 minutes)
Your working prompt from incubation needs to be formalized with explicit constraints.
Before (Incubation - Conversational):
You're a helpful customer support agent. Answer questions about our product.
Be nice and escalate if needed.
After (Production - Explicit Constraints):
# production/agent/prompts.py

CUSTOMER_SUCCESS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a Customer Success agent for TechCorp SaaS.

## Your Purpose
Handle routine customer support queries with speed, accuracy, and empathy across multiple channels.

## Channel Awareness
You receive messages from three channels. Adapt your communication style:
- **Email**: Formal, detailed responses. Include proper greeting and signature.
- **WhatsApp**: Concise, conversational. Keep responses under 300 characters when possible.
- **Web Form**: Semi-formal, helpful. Balance detail with readability.

## Required Workflow (ALWAYS follow this order)
1. FIRST: Call `create_ticket` to log the interaction
2. THEN: Call `get_customer_history` to check for prior context
3. THEN: Call `search_knowledge_base` if product questions arise
4. FINALLY: Call `send_response` to reply (NEVER respond without this tool)

## Hard Constraints (NEVER violate)
- NEVER discuss pricing → escalate immediately with reason "pricing_inquiry"
- NEVER promise features not in documentation
- NEVER process refunds → escalate with reason "refund_request"
- NEVER share internal processes or system details
- NEVER respond without using send_response tool
- NEVER exceed response limits: Email=500 words, WhatsApp=300 chars, Web=300 words

## Escalation Triggers (MUST escalate when detected)
- Customer mentions "lawyer", "legal", "sue", or "attorney"
- Customer uses profanity or aggressive language (sentiment < 0.3)
- Cannot find relevant information after 2 search attempts
- Customer explicitly requests human help
- Customer on WhatsApp sends "human", "agent", or "representative"

## Response Quality Standards
- Be concise: Answer the question directly, then offer additional help
- Be accurate: Only state facts from knowledge base or verified customer data
- Be empathetic: Acknowledge frustration before solving problems
- Be actionable: End with clear next step or question

## Context Variables Available
- {{customer_id}}: Unique customer identifier
- {{conversation_id}}: Current conversation thread
- {{channel}}: Current channel (email/whatsapp/web_form)
- {{ticket_subject}}: Original subject/topic
"""
Step 5: Create the Transition Test Suite (1 hour)
Before building production infrastructure, ensure your agent logic still works.
# production/tests/test_transition.py
"""
Transition Tests: Verify agent behavior matches incubation discoveries.
Run these BEFORE deploying to production.

Step 6: The Transition Checklist
Use this checklist to ensure you haven’t missed anything:
## Pre-Transition Checklist

### From Incubation (Must Have Before Proceeding)
- [ ] Working prototype that handles basic queries
- [ ] Documented edge cases (minimum 10)
- [ ] Working system prompt
- [ ] MCP tools defined and tested
- [ ] Channel-specific response patterns identified
- [ ] Escalation rules finalized
- [ ] Performance baseline measured

### Transition Steps
- [ ] Created production folder structure
- [ ] Extracted prompts to prompts.py
- [ ] Converted MCP tools to @function_tool
- [ ] Added Pydantic input validation to all tools
- [ ] Added error handling to all tools
- [ ] Created transition test suite
- [ ] All transition tests passing

### Ready for Production Build
- [ ] Database schema designed
- [ ] Kafka topics defined
- [ ] Channel handlers outlined
- [ ] Kubernetes resource requirements estimated
- [ ] API endpoints listed
Common Transition Mistakes (Avoid These!)
Mistake
Why It Happens
How to Avoid
Skipping documentation
“I remember what worked”
Write it down immediately
Copying code directly
“It worked in prototype”
Refactor for production patterns
Ignoring edge cases
“We’ll fix those later”
Test edge cases first
Hardcoding values
“Just for now”
Use config from day 1
No error handling
“It didn’t crash before”
Everything can fail at scale
Forgetting channel differences
“One response fits all”
Test each channel separately

Transition Complete Criteria
You’re ready to proceed to Part 2 (Specialization) when:
✅ All transition tests pass
✅ Prompts are extracted and documented
✅ Tools have proper input validation
✅ Error handling exists for all tools
✅ Edge cases are documented with test cases
✅ Production folder structure is created

Part 2: The Specialization Phase (Hours 17-40)
Objective
Transform your incubated prototype into a production-grade Custom Agent that runs 24/7 on Kubernetes with Kafka for event streaming and multi-channel intake.
Your Role: Builder
You are now engineering for reliability, scale, and governance.

Exercise 2.1: Database Schema - Your CRM System (2-3 hours)
Design your PostgreSQL schema for production state management with multi-channel support. This database IS your CRM/ticket management system - you are building a custom solution that tracks customers, conversations, tickets, and all interactions across channels.
Why build your own CRM? In production environments, companies often integrate with enterprise CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot). However, for this hackathon, building your own system teaches you the fundamentals of customer data management, and your PostgreSQL-based solution provides all the functionality needed for a working Digital FTE.

# Define the Agent with channel awareness
customer_success_agent = Agent(
    name="Customer Success FTE",
    model="gpt-4o",
    instructions="""You are a Customer Success agent for TechCorp SaaS.

## Your Purpose
Handle routine customer support queries with speed, accuracy, and empathy across multiple channels.

## Channel Awareness
You receive messages from three channels. Adapt your communication style:
- **Email**: Formal, detailed responses. Include proper greeting and signature.
- **WhatsApp**: Concise, conversational. Keep responses under 300 characters when possible.
- **Web Form**: Semi-formal, helpful. Balance detail with readability.

## Core Behaviors
1. ALWAYS create a ticket at conversation start (include channel!)
2. Check customer history ACROSS ALL CHANNELS before responding
3. Search knowledge base before answering product questions
4. Be concise on WhatsApp, detailed on email
5. Monitor sentiment - escalate if customer becomes frustrated

## Hard Constraints
- NEVER discuss pricing - escalate immediately
- NEVER promise features not in documentation
- NEVER process refunds - escalate to billing
- NEVER share internal processes or systems
- ALWAYS use send_response tool to reply (ensures proper channel formatting)

## Escalation Triggers
- Customer mentions "lawyer", "legal", or "sue"
- Customer uses profanity or aggressive language
- You cannot find relevant information after 2 searches
- Customer explicitly requests human help
- WhatsApp customer sends 'human' or 'agent'

## Cross-Channel Continuity
If a customer has contacted us before (any channel), acknowledge it:
"I see you contacted us previously about X. Let me help you further..."

        search_knowledge_base,

Recommended Tools
Development: Claude Code, VS Code, Docker Desktop
Database/CRM: PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector extension (this IS your CRM - no external CRM needed)
Streaming: Apache Kafka (use Confluent Cloud for simplicity)
Kubernetes: minikube (local) or any cloud provider
Email: Gmail API with Pub/Sub
WhatsApp: Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox (for development)
What You Don’t Need
❌ External CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.) - PostgreSQL is your CRM
❌ Full website - Only the support form component
❌ Production WhatsApp Business account - Twilio Sandbox is sufficient

FAQ
Q: Do I need to integrate with Salesforce, HubSpot, or another CRM? A: No. The PostgreSQL database you build IS your CRM system. The schema includes tables for customers, conversations, tickets, and messages - this is all you need. In a real production environment, you might sync this data to enterprise CRMs, but that’s outside the scope of this hackathon.
Q: Do I need real Gmail and WhatsApp accounts? A: For development, use Gmail API sandbox and Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox. These provide free testing capabilities without affecting real accounts.
Q: Is the entire website required? A: No. Only the Web Support Form component is required. It should be embeddable but doesn’t need a surrounding website.
Q: How do I test WhatsApp without Twilio costs? A: Twilio provides a free WhatsApp Sandbox. Join it by sending a WhatsApp message to their sandbox number.
Q: Can I skip a channel? A: The Web Support Form is required. Gmail and WhatsApp integrations are expected but partial implementations are acceptable with documented limitations.

Final Challenge: The 24-Hour Multi-Channel Test
After deployment, your FTE must survive a 24-hour continuous operation test across all channels:
Web Form Traffic: 100+ submissions over 24 hours
Email Simulation: 50+ Gmail messages processed
WhatsApp Simulation: 50+ WhatsApp messages processed
Cross-Channel: 10+ customers contact via multiple channels
Chaos Testing: Random pod kills every 2 hours
Metrics Validation: - Uptime > 99.9% - P95 latency < 3 seconds (all channels) - Escalation rate < 25% - Cross-channel customer identification > 95% - No message loss
Teams that pass the 24-hour multi-channel test have built a true omnichannel Digital FTE.

Welcome to the future of customer support. Now build it.
